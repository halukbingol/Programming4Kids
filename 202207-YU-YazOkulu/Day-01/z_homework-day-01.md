# What we covered
This week

- We install VSC and Google Chrome.
- We downloaded files from Google drive to a folder in our computer. 

- We practice to describe a path to a dummy, which will be our computer.
- We learn how to draw a circle in `z-1-circle.html`.

# To do
(Every student should do this part.)

1. Make sure that the directory structure in your disk is as given below.

	```
	2022-PrePlus
	|- Day-00
	|  |- Student info.md
	|  |- ...
	|- Day-01
	|  |- snap_0-2circle.html
	|  |- ...
	|- Day-02
	|- ...
	```

1. Keep playing the game on <https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding?hl=en?>.
	- Think about how to develope such a game.
	- What kind of simple tools would you need in order to code such a game.

1. Play path description game with your friends. 
	- Try to make the description as necessary and sufficient as possible. 
	- Let them describe to you and you play the dummy one. 
	- Do your best to misunderstand the description as much as possibly. This is very important in order to understand how to program.



1. Make copies of `snap_0-2circle.html` and name them such as
`snap_0-2circle-01.html`,
`snap_0-2circle-02.html`.
	- In each copy change the numbers in the following lines:

	```js
	let bigCircle = s.circle(150, 150, 100);
	...
	let smallCircle = s.circle(100, 150, 70);
	```

	- Try to understand what happens when you change each one of them.
	
1. Consider the lines given below. 

	```js
        fill: "#bada55",
        stroke: "#000",
	```

	- Change `"#bada55"` ve `"#000"` with any 6-character combination, such as `"123456"`, `"ddccff"`, selected from the set 
`{0, 1, 2, ..., 9, a, b, c, d, e, f}`.
	- Try to understand the effect.
   




# Challenge
(This part is for advanced students.)

Now you can control your circles on the screen.


1.  you can write letters such as letter "I" below.
