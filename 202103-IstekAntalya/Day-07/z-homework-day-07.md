Homework for Day-07
---
bingol, 2021-03-17

We learned `for`-loop. The syntax is

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // body
}
```

which is conceptually equivalent to

```javascript
for (
    let i = 0;
    i < 10;
    i++
) {
    // body
}
```

# Homework

1. Remember the challenge in the homework of Day-01. It was to write letters "I", "L", and "H" with circles. Redo it
   using `for`-loops. See how shorter your code become.

1. Remember the challenge in the homework of Day-06. Think of shorter ways to design roads for our turtle. Design a
   road, which has some forks and loops, such as a road of shape "8".

# Challenge

1. Have the turtle walk the road that you just designed.

1. Design letters such as "A", "O" with circles.
