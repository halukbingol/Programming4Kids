Homework for Day-01

We have learned how to draw a circle on the screen as in `snap_intro.html`. 
We have discussed the meaning of the parameters 
`x_1`, `y_1`, `r_1`, `colorFill_1`, `colorStroke_1`, and `strokeWidth_1`
in

```javascript
let circle1 = s.circle(x_1, y_1, r_1);
circle1.attr({
    fill: colorFill_1,
    stroke: colorStroke_1,
    strokeWidth: strokeWidth_1
});
```

Then we make it more parametric in `snap_intro_v4_parametric.html`.


1. Make a copy of `snap_intro.html`.

1. Change `x_1`, `y_1`, `r_1`, `colorFill_1`, `colorStroke_1`, and `strokeWidth_1` values.
Make sure that you understand what they do?
   


1. For fun.
   Would you please play with this game by Google
   at https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding?hl=en?
   We will discuss it in the next lecture.
    - Think how would you code such a game.
    - What should be the steps.


# Challenge

Since you can control your circles on the screen you can write letters such as letter "I" below.
