# Homework

We used to have javascript code in html file. Now, we use javascript code in separate `.js` files.

The "challenge" in Day-05 was to have buttons to control the movements of the turtle.
See the solutions in `z-homework-day-05-byButton-solution.html`.

This time we will push turtle to be more independent. 
In file pairs `FRL-v4.html` and `turtle-v4.js`, we started to get turtle self-contained. We will proceed on that even further.

1. The pair `z-homework-day-05-byButton-solution.html` and `z-homework-day-05-turtle.js` is a little bit different than what we have done today. Try to understand how they work by single stepping the code.
1. Download files `z-FRL-hw-v0.html` and `z-turtle-hw-v0.js`. Make sure that you understand the pair by single step debugging.
Note that the left turn needs to be corrected.
1. Get new versions as `z-FRL-hw-v1.html` and `z-turtle-hw-v1.js`.
Make the necessary changes so that buttons "F", "L", and "R" and the buttons control the turtle.



# Challenge

We had the road that turtle walks on in `z-homework-day-03-solution.html`.

1. Make a new version `z-FRL-hw-v2.html`. Can you get the road as another file, say `z-road-hw-v1.js` so that `z-turtle-hw-v1.js`, `z-road-hw-v1.js`, and `z-FRL-hw-v2.html` have the turtle and the road are visible.
1. Put the turtle in one of squares and navigate it in the road by proper pressing the buttons.
Hint. Do not pay attention if the turtle goes away from the road.
1. Investigate `turtleIsIn()` in `z-homework-day-03-solution.html`. Can you modify so that you can use it here? Hint. This is not an easy task.
