# What we covered
This week we did many important steps.

- install Google Chrome.
- install VSC.
- add Live server extension to VSC.
- download files from Google drive to our disk.
- unzip the downloaded zip file.
- Now we have `202203-AFL-Days` directory in our computer.
- open `202203-AFL-Days` directory in VSC.
- open `KidsCoding.html` and run it in Chrome so that we played with "Celebrating 50 years of Kids Coding"
- practice how to explain step-by-step how to move in a maze.
- practice to describe a path to a dummy, which will be our computer.
- learn how to draw a circle in `circle-2.html`.

# To do
(*Every student should do this part.*)

1. Make sure that the directory structure in your disk is as given below.

	```
	202203-AFL-Days
	|- Day-00
	|  |- KSC-VSC.md
	|  |- ...
	|- Day-01
	|  |- circle-2.html
	|  |- ...
	|- Day-02
	|- ...
	```

1. Keep playing the game on <https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding?hl=en?>.
	- Think about how to develope such a game.
	- What kind of simple tools would you need in order to code such a game.


1. Play path description game with your friends. 
	- Try to make the description as necessary and sufficient as possible. 
	- Let them describe to you and you play the dummy one. 
	- Do your best to misunderstand the description as much as possibly. This is very important in order to understand how to program.


1. Search internet for "algorithmic thinking" and "computational thinking".


1. Identify functions, such as open file, that you used so far while using VSC. Add their key short cuts to `KSC-VSC.md`. Find reloac key short cut for "reloading" Chrome and add that to `KSC-Chrome.md`.


1. Make copies of `circle-2.html` and name them such as
`circle-2-v1.html`,
`circle-2-v2.html`, ....
	- In each copy change the numbers in the following lines:

	```js
	let bigCircle = s.circle(160, 140, 100);...
	let smallCircle = s.circle(90, 150, 70);
	```

	- Try to understand what happens when you change each one of them.


1. Consider the lines given below. 

	```js
        fill: "#bada55",
        stroke: "#000",
	```

	- Change `"#bada55"` ve `"#000"` with any 6-character combination, such as `"123456"`, `"ddccff"`, selected from the set 
`{0, 1, 2, ..., 9, a, b, c, d, e, f}`.
	- Try to understand the effect.
   




# Challenge
(*This part is for advanced students.*)

Now you can control your circles on the screen.


1.  You can write letters such as letter "I" below.

	![aa](z-homework-day-01-letter_I.jpg)


1. Similarly write letters "I", "L", "H" harflerini in files named as `letter_I.html`, `letter_L.html`, and `letter_H.html`.


1. Letters such as "A", "B", "O" are little bit more difficult to make but doable. Try.


1. Try to write your name using these letters.
